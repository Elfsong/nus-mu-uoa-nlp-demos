                    <p class="para-ai"><strong>Abstract:</strong> The recent advancements in deep learning have led to
                      the state-of-the-art performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Most of the
                      contemporary ASR systems are end-to-end based that jointly learn acoustic model, pronunciation
                      model, and language model. The end-to-end ASR systems work well for resource-rich languages like
                      English and Mandarin. However, these ASR systems tend to perform worst on the languages that do
                      not have enough training data and other linguistic resources needed for building a robust speech
                      recognition system. These languages are referred to as low resource languages. In the past few
                      years, many studies have focused on low resource languages and have proposed numerous solutions.
                      In this talk, I will discuss various solutions proposed for building ASR systems for low resource
                      languages. These solutions include multilingual ASR systems, cross-lingual transfer learning
                      systems, meta learning based system, semi-supervised learning based systems, and data augmentation
                      approaches. Lastly, I will also present some of the initial results for the Māori (spoken in New
                      Zealand) and Punjabi language (native to India and Pakistan).</p>

                      Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow at CMU. In 2013, she moved to Singapore to join NUS where she is now an
                      Associate Professor. She works on variation phenomena in English, Irish Gaelic, Mandarin,
                      Cantonese, Japanese and Korean. She is primarily interested in the acquisition of sociolinguistic
                      knowledge among bilingual children and is working on the Singapore Multilingual Corpus to document
                      and investigate the speech of multilinguals in Singapore.</p>
                    <p class="para-ai"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Scholarship in language variation and change has
                      investigated the mechanisms and outcomes of dialect contact in a number of settings around the
                      world. In variationist work, contact-induced change is typically argued to stem primarily from
                      prolonged interpersonal contact, rather than from short-term travel or media exposure, as regular
                      interaction is thought to be necessary for the transmission of complex linguistic features. In
                      research in the world Englishes and contact linguistics traditions, however, media exposure is
                      often pointed to as a source of language change; moreover, the notion that speakers adopt new
                      features as a result of short-term travel and media consumption is a commonly-circulating
                      discourse in postcolonial societies. This talk considers the impact of three major sources of
                      transnational dialect contact — institutional exonormativity, transnational mobility, and media
                      consumption — on variation and change in the English and Mandarin spoken in Singapore, a
                      multilingual nation in Southeast Asia. The issues and findings surveyed here underscore the
                      utility of applying variationist approaches to world English-speaking communities and other
                      postcolonial settings. Correspondingly, they illustrate how research in such settings may shed new
                      light on basic assumptions in the field of language variation and change.</p>
